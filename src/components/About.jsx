        <p>
          I'm a Full-Stack Developer with a Master's in Applied Computer and IT, specializing in Accessibility & Universal Design. 
          I love building applications that make technology more inclusive and user-friendly. 
          Currently, I'm expanding my backend skills with Node.js to become a more complete developer. 
          Outside of coding, I enjoy reading, playing video games, and hiking in nature to recharge.
